        <!-- <p class="text">Since I have started this career path many things have changed about me.  I have felt more insecure, stressed and at the same time eager to learn then ever before.  Having to manage my work life with my personal life is no joke.  I find myself wanting to be on the computer more so that I can understand things better. Having that said, this is a bit of a problem for my personal life.  How to manage both is the big question...  </p>

        <p class="text-faded">I am going to have to handle it the way I would if I was coding.  One bit at a time.  I tend to overthing or jump too far ahead with everything.  You got to live life in the moment so there for I need to start by breaking down the time I have on the computer and learn to disconnect.</p> -->
